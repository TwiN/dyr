# dyr

Do you remember? is a tool meant to help you remember these nifty tricks you once learned.

As a programmer, I keep learning new useful tricks, but unfortunately, they escape my memory every now and then -- sometimes to be rediscovered at a later date, others to be simply forgotten in the river of time.

This very simple command line tool's purpose is very simple: help you save and remind you of these tricks.

Obviously, it doesn't have to be useful tricks, it can be anything you want it to be:
- Good memories
- Accomplishments 
- Jokes
- Quotes
- Other stuffs

I personally add `dyr` at the bottom of my `.bashrc` so that every time I open a new terminal, I get reminded.
